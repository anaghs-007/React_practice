### Potential Improvements:
- UI Fixtures
- The application possesses a bug in the editing of tasks. When the user clicks the edit button, and then checks the completed check box, the particular item continues to remain in editing mode, making it possible to edit that specific list item even after being marked as 'completed: true'.
